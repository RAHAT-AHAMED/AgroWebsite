               The Haller Journey involves working with local communities to lay the groundwork for transformation. These processes create crucial foundations for healthy soil and food production. During the initial phase of the Haller Journey, we work with impoverished communities to provide water security, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) creating suitable conditions for smallholder farming. <br><br>
               Haller Kenya conducts a geological survey to site all the water projects appropriately. This ensures that the dam is in an appropriate catchment area, the well is sited to access the local water table and the eco-loo is placed to avoid run-off contaminating groundwater surfaces. The work is overseen by Haller Kenya and the community are paid for every cubic metre of earth they remove, which is typically reinvested into the purchase of farming materials. <br><br>
               Once the WASH Projects have been completed, communities will have water available for drinking, irrigation and eco- sanitary facilities. Women will not have to spend hours walking in search of drinking water, instead, they are able to tend to the community plots, and children are free from water collection duties to attend school.
               <br> <br>
               We have now constructed 53 wells, 47 eco-loos and 54 rain-fed dams across 54 communities. <br>
